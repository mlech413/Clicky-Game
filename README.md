# `The Simpsons` Clicky-Game

## `Hours of Fun!!!`

Click on a Simpsons character. But don't forget who you picked, because they will move around and you can't pick them again! If you get through all 12 characters, you win. Goo luck!

## `About`

This React application keeps track of the user's selections and score. High score is recorded, with 12 being the highest possible. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if clicking the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

## `Get Started`

The application can be accesed at https://mlech413.github.io/Clicky-Game/. Enjoy!
